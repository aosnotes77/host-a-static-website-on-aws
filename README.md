# Host a Static Website on AWS

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to host a static HTML web application on AWS, utilizing various AWS services for enhanced security, reliability, and scalability. 

## Architecture
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Configured with public and private subnets across two availability zones.
- **Internet Gateway:** Deployed to enable connectivity between VPC instances and the internet.
- **Security Groups:** Act as a network firewall.
- **Availability Zones:** Utilization of two zones for reliability and fault tolerance.
- **Public Subnets:** Used for NAT Gateway and Application Load Balancer.
- **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint:** For secure connections within subnets.
- **Private Subnets:** Host web servers (EC2 instances) for security.
- **NAT Gateway:** Provides internet access for instances in private subnets.
- **EC2 Instances:** Hosting the website.
- **Application Load Balancer & Auto Scaling Group:** Distributes traffic and manages EC2 instances.
- **GitHub:** Stores web files for version control and collaboration.
- **Certificate Manager:** Secures application communications.
- **Simple Notification Service (SNS):** Alerts for activities within the Auto Scaling Group.
- **Route 53:** Domain name registration and DNS setup.
